# Embedded Systems

This is the repository for the code files of the **Embedded Systems** lecture at the [TEC - Computer Engineering Group](https://tec.ee.ethz.ch) which is part of the [Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory](https://tik.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich taught by Prof. Dr. Lothar Thiele. The lecture covered the following topics:

- Embedded system fundamentals: hardware-software combination for specific functions
- Specific requirements and challenges in embedded system applications
- Architectures and components of embedded systems
- Hardware-software interfaces and memory architecture
- Communication between system components
- Embedded operating systems, specifically FreeRTOS
- Real-time scheduling theory
- Methods for managing shared resources
- Low-power and low-energy design principles
- Hardware architecture synthesis
- Practical application using C programming
- Design and development on a commercial embedded system platform
- Laboratory sessions for hands-on experience
    
The repository contains a folder with the code to the labs, where all of the theoretical knowledge of the lecture had to be applied. The labs are based on the ARM-​based [TI MSP432 Launchpad](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP432E401Y) a state-​of-the-art embedded system development kit featuring a high-​performance low-​power microcontroller.
